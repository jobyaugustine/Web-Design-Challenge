# Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

Web page is developed with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap components.

The navigaton to different pages are done using the navbar component of bootstrap.

The navigation path is possible for
 1) Landing page
 2) Plots - as dropdown menu for navigating to Max Temperature, Humidity , Cloudiness and Windspeed scatter plots.
 3) Comparison - for comparing the different scatter plots.
 4) Data - navigating to the data table used for the analysis which is developed fro the csv file of the cities weather data.

The website has 7 pages.

The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:

* A [landing page](#index.html) has the Summary, Visualizations of all the scatter plots.
  
* The data is converted from csv to HTML using pandas. Used the `to_html` method for conversion to html. [JupyterNotebookFile](Convert_CSVtoHTML_Table.ipynb)

Finally, the website must be deployed to GitHub pages.
